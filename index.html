            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello there, I'm Onkabetse. I am currently a student at the North-West University, studying a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics. 
                I have interests in everything, ranging from music to artificial intelligence. I am very much a multifaceted individual and strive to do my best as well as enjoy everything I do.
            This website is where I document some of the most important things in my life and it represents the beginning of me working towards being an exceptional software developer.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="projects">
            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>Here are some of my projects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personal Website</li>
                <p>When I started the second year of my degree, I noticed that I had not started developing any personal projects because I thought I would learn everything in my university courses/modules. 
                   This essentially forced me to self-introspect and ask myself where my interests lie in the computer science field. I knew I was very much interested in software development and cybersecurity,
                   but it seemed too soon to start a full-fledged project on both. After some time, the thought of developing a website appealed to me, as I always wondered how websites and apps are developed.
                   Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all on my own with no prior experience in any of them taught me important skills that I am eager to apply in any workplace and even in my personal life.</p>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="achievements">
            <h2>Achievements</h2>
            <p>Throughout my high school journey, I had constantly been honored with top of the class accolades and had always outshone my peers in every subject I took, but it is my matric year which stood out because not only did I outshine my classmates, but I also towered above all matriculants from my sub-district. Achieving a full house of distinctions as well as an average of 90% in the NSC Examinations placed me at the top spot in the sub-district, top 10 in the district and one of the top performers in the North-West Province. I have always worked both smart and hard, but the magnitude of my achievements showed me that there is really no limit to my potential. In university, I continue to obtain considerably good results and strive to not only better myself, but help other students along the way, which equips me with good leadership and teamwork skills.</p>
